## On this branch I will be implementing the next-auth stuff
* As it's necessary to delete most of the stuff i did for my own method of user authentication, and it still needs a lot of cleaning up,
I will be implementing the couple of auth methods as while also including my database

* now going to change the style and the function of the login process a little so it fits better with the flow of the website

* I couldn't find enough information on how to handle the erros in my custom sign page for sign ins using credentials, instead of in the action I will try to handle it with a fetch request in an event handler
