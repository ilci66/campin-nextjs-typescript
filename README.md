* There will be posts about camping and camping related topics
* Planning on adding a map with the camping hotspots
* Decided to do the styling using css only
* I could use bootstrap for the sign in modal at least but it seems easier I might not learn anything new if I go with bootstrap
* Instead of going with the sign up page decided to create another modal for sign ups
* Note to self: Don't forget to use fontawesome later
* Note to self: Gonna have to create a context for the user and update it from the navbar to keep it consistent throughout the website, sign in and sign out is also handled there
* I feel like typescript it making it harder at this point but everyone seems to love it so gonna stick to it I guess
* Gonna use next auth for social media sign ins but I wanna also implement the credentials method with jwt and include my database in it as well 
* Not actually thinking about making protected routes but I wanna make sure I can implement jwt auth with email adress and a password


* GOT A LITTLE CONFUSED WITH THE ROUTES BUT NECESSARY NOTES FOR FUTURE ADDED
## Left at index.ts in api/auth, check for keys, if they don't exist create them, create paylaod, sign jwts, usual stuff (reminder)
## Gotta do some deeper reading on http headers cookies and storage
