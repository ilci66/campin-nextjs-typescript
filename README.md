* There will be posts about camping and camping related topics
* Planning on adding a map with the camping hotspots
* Decided to do the styling using css only
* I could use bootstrap for the sign in modal at least but it seems easier I might not learn anything new if I go with bootstrap
* Note to self: Don't forget to use fontawesome later
* Note to self: Gonna have to create a context for the user and update it from the navbar to keep it consistent throughout the website, sign in and sign out is also handled there
* I feel like typescript it making it harder at this point but everyone seems to love it so gonna stick to it I guess
* Gonna use next auth for social media sign ins but I wanna also implement the credentials method with jwt and include my database in it as well 
* I could easily save everything into session storage set an expiration date or something but I don't have much practise on cookies, that's why I used jwt and cookies 


* GOT A LITTLE CONFUSED WITH THE ROUTES BUT NECESSARY NOTES FOR FUTURE ADDED
## Now working on the loading message while fetching all the necessary infromation, the message will be replaced by the name of the user in the navbar
## The name in the navbar thing is going to have to wait until I figure out how to work with next-auth 

## A I implemeted my method with my database now gonna use the credential along with couple of social media auth methods of next-auth, looks cleaner
