# Merged the branches as it's no longer necessary to go on with another branch 

* now going to change the style and the function of the login process a little so it fits better with the flow of the website

* I couldn't find enough information on how to handle the erros in my custom sign page for sign ins using credentials, instead of in the action I will try to handle it with a fetch request in an event handler 

* Fixed the error with credentai sign in but still need to handle errors and show error messages to the user, working on it.

* In the sign in form the label is moving away on hover but on nothing else, trying to figure out why

## I should definitely consider the design, colours and the overall structure before I jump in, I wasted so much time
