# Merged the branches as it's no longer necessary to go on with another branch 
## I should definitely consider the design, colours and the overall structure before I jump in, I wasted so much time 
* Gonna work on the custom map where users will be able to add custom markers to the map, never done something like this before so doing some reading for now
* For some reason the example for react on the google cloud platform for setting up the map doesn't work, gonna look for an alternative 
* Created Testing-map.tsx component to test some features, mostly react-map-gl stuff
* Still have no idea about how to get the location of a click event on map using react-map-gl, trying bunch of the r options until I find what I need
